# SecurityApp
Innovation project

Vehicular Monitoring App Project: 

This android app uses the video feed from the entrance gate to recognise the numberplate on a vehicle entering into the premises. This was aimed to reinforce the security and expedite the flow of vehicles by registering and authenticating them automatically using the database. 

Technologies used are Andriod, Google Vision Api, Python and openCV.
